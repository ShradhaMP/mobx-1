// Note:
// This is how the component is going to be aware that it needs to re-render/ have a reaction based off updating our athletes.
// observer: is a Higher order component & Wrap our 'Roster' component. And this lets MobX know that, this component is listening into some state values from our Observables, from Athletes for example: name or age & it should update whenever those values are updated as well.
